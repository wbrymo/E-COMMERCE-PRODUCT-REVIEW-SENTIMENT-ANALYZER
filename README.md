# üõíE-COMMERCE-PRODUCT-REVIEW-SENTIMENT-ANALYZER

Classifying customer product reviews into Positive or Negative sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an automated sentiment analysis system for e-commerce product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).
The goal is to help online retailers and businesses extract actionable insights from customer feedback to improve user experience, identify areas of dissatisfaction, and make data-driven marketing decisions.

The system processes raw text reviews, cleans and tokenizes the data, extracts features using TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words (BoW), and classifies sentiments using multiple machine learning algorithms.
A user-friendly Streamlit web app was developed to allow interactive sentiment predictions in real time.

# Objectives

Automate sentiment classification of e-commerce product reviews.

Evaluate and compare rule-based and ML-based sentiment models.

Deploy the best-performing model on a web interface for end-user interaction.

Provide insights that can guide businesses in improving customer satisfaction and product quality.

# Tools, Libraries & Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

NLTK (for text cleaning and tokenization)

TF-IDF Vectorizer & Bag-of-Words

VADER Sentiment Analysis

Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes

GridSearchCV (for hyperparameter tuning)

Streamlit (for deployment)

Environment:

Jupyter Notebook

VS Code / Anaconda

GitHub

# Workflow / Steps to Execute
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection

The dataset consisted of customer product reviews with associated metadata (rating, date, and location).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed HTML tags, punctuation, URLs, and unnecessary symbols.

Tokenized the reviews using NLTK.

Removed stopwords and lemmatized text to reduce inflectional forms.

Replaced missing values in reviewer and country columns.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

Applied TF-IDF to weigh the importance of words across documents.

Implemented Bag-of-Words (BoW) for baseline comparison.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized review distribution across ratings and years.

Identified that the majority of reviews were 1-star and 5-star, showing polarized opinions.

Found most reviews originated from the US, UK, and Canada.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building

Trained multiple models:

Naive Bayes (BoW) ‚Äî 93% accuracy

SVM (TF-IDF) ‚Äî best performance with 94% accuracy and 0.94 F1-score

VADER (rule-based) ‚Äî 76% accuracy for baseline comparison

6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV improved SVM‚Äôs performance on edge-case sentiments.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment

Deployed the final SVM model using Streamlit.
Users can type or paste product reviews and instantly see whether they are classified as Positive or Negative.

# Results & Key Insights
Model	---------------Technique-------------Accuracy------------F1-Score---------------Notes

Naive Bayes---------Bag-of-Words--------------93%----------------0.92---------------Solid baseline model

SVM-------------------TF-IDF--------------------94%----------------0.94---------------Best performing model

VADER---------------Lexicon-based-------------76%----------------0.70---------------Struggled with nuanced reviews

Key Findings:

The majority of reviews were polarized between 1-star and 5-star.

SVM with TF-IDF captured subtle contextual patterns better than rule-based models.

The web app allows non-technical users to analyze sentiment interactively.

# Recommendations

Integrate deep learning models like BERT or LSTM for context-aware multilingual sentiment detection.

Expand dataset to include more regions for global sentiment coverage.

Incorporate real-time monitoring to track customer feedback trends.

# Business Impact

Helped e-commerce teams prioritize negative feedback for quick resolution.

Provided sentiment-driven insights for marketing, product improvement, and customer retention.

Enabled automated sentiment scoring without manual labeling.
